    <h1>Aloo Paratha</h1>
    <p>It is made using unleavened dough rolled with a mixture of mashed potato and spices (amchur, garam masala) which is cooked on a hot tawa with butter or ghee.[5][6] Aloo paratha is usually served with butter, chutney, curd, or Indian pickles.[7][8]

        Being stuffed with potato and fried makes it higher in calories (290-360 calories) than a typical roti (60 calories).[6]
        
        In the 21st century, due to convenience, working routines, rising household incomes, smaller families and time restrictions, the aloo paratha breakfast for urban Indians has been increasingly replaced by foods seen as more convenient such as cereals.[4] A similar pattern has been observed among Central Valley Sikhs in America.[2]
