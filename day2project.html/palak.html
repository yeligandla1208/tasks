   <h1>Palak Paneer</h1>
    <p>Palak paneer is served hot with a side dish such as roti, naan, parathas, makki ki roti, or boiled rice. It can also be served with onions on the side for a more traditional approach.

        In recent years, there have been fusion variations of palak paneer. In July 2020, a Bangalore-based food blogger posted her variation of palak paneer idli. The dish sparked conversation on Twitter and Instagram about the unusual combination of these two North and South Indian dishes.
